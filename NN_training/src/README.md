# Building traning data and training neural networks



- To calculate the offline performance we build the data using the file: ml_io_no_qp_flux_nn_for_offline.py. Using this file ensures that the validation data and the training data are taken from different time periods. 

- When we trained the NN that were used in online simulation we build the training data using ml_io_no_qp_flux_nn.py (where the validation and training are chosen at random).
